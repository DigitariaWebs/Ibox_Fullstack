## Screen Flow

1. **OnboardingEntryScreen** - Welcome screen with "Let's start" button ✅
2. **AccountTypeScreen** - Choose customer or transporter ✅
3. **IdentityScreen** - Personal info and credentials ✅
4. **OTPVerificationScreen** - 6-digit verification code ✅
5. **AddressLocaleScreen** - Address and language selection ✅
6a. **PaymentMethodScreen** - Payment method setup (customers) ✅
6b. **CustomerAccountTypeScreen** - Business account setup (customers) ✅
7. **TransporterVehicleScreen** - Vehicle details and photos ✅
8. **TransporterComplianceScreen** - License and insurance ✅
9. **TransporterBankingScreen** - Banking details ✅
10. **ConfirmationScreen** - Final review and submission ✅

## State Management

- Uses React Context (`SignUpContext`) for state management
- Automatic persistence to AsyncStorage
- Type-safe with TypeScript interfaces
- Validation with Yup schemas

## Navigation Flow

From AuthSelectionScreen:
- "Join neighborhood" → OnboardingEntryScreen
- "Log in" → LoginModal

The signup flow is wrapped with SignUpProvider context for state management.
